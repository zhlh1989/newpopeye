## A Word From Our `Meager Sponsor...

## Change Logs

### Non zero exit

The Popeye binary will now return a non zero exit status if warnings or errors are raised during a cluster scan. This provides an affordance for CI/CD pipeline scripts to fail a deployment based on the scan reports outcomes.

### Excluding containers from report

In this drop, we've added a new spinach option to exclude certain containers for the scans. Here is a an example of a spinach file that will omit given containers from the scans.

```yaml
popeye:
  # Excludes define rules to exempt resources from scans
  excludes:
    v1/pods:
      - name: rx:icx/.*
        containers:
          # Excludes istio init and sidecar container from scan!
          - istio-proxy
          - istio-init
```
