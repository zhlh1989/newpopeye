## Change Logs

In this drop, we've cleaned up a few code duds and addressed a bit of debt.

### Prometheus Report

Thanks to an awesome contribution by [dardanel](https://github.com/eminugurkenar), Popeye can now report sanitization issues as Prometheus metrics. Thus, you will have the ability to run Popeye in cluster as a job and push sanitization metrics back to the prometheus mothership. How cool is that? As it stands these will just be reported as raw counts and thus you won't have sanitization details but you can leverage Prometheus AlertManager to trigger your clusters investigation based on these reports.
