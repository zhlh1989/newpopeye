## Change Logs

### ConfigMap and Secrets Support

Added Sanitizer reports for ConfigMap and Secrets. Popeye now scans your clusters for potential dead cm or secret resources and there associated data keys.

### Jurassic World Support

Added --jurassic|-j aka *NeanderTerm* mode, for terminals that don't support dazzling emojis and smashing colors.

### Refactored!

Went thru a pretty significant refactor on this drop, so please be on the lookout for potential *disturbance in the force* and report any issues you may encounter. Thank you!!
