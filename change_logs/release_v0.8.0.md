## Change Logs

Maintenance Release!

### Kubernetes 1.18

In this drop we've updated Popeye to support the latest api changes provided by kubernetes v1.18.

### Breaking Changes!

As of this release, we've changed popeye's configuration file to leverage GVRs (group/version/resource) notation in the spinach.yml file. In order to pickup your configurations you will need to update your spinach file as follows:

```yaml
# spinach.yml
popeye:
  # Excludes define rules to exampt resources from sanitization
  excludes:
    # NOTE: Change to GVR notation vs section names.
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterrolebinding:
      - name: rx:system
        codes:
          - 400
    apps/v1/daemonset:
      - name: rx:kube
```
