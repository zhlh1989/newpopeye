## Change Logs

### HTML Reports!

Big thanks in this release and ATTA Boy! goes to (Barak Stout)[https://github.com/BarakStout] for making HTML sanitizers reports available for all of us.

In order to start spewing out HTML formatted Popeye's report use the following command:

```shell
# Generates a Popeye sanitizer HTML report
popeye -o html --save
```

And you'll get something like this...

### Cluster Name Override

In most cases, when running Popeye in cluster, the cluster name won't be available as a kubeconfig is generally not available. Thanks to the great contributions from [Karan Magdani](https://github.com/karanmagdani1), you can now add
a cli arg `k8s-popeye-cluster-name` to set your cluster name for your in cluster sanitizer reports.
