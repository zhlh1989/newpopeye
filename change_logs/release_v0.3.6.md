## Change Logs

### Spinach Exclude

The exclude section of the yaml now supports regular expresions. In order to designate a regular expression matcher your exclude must start with `rx:`. Here are some examples:

```yaml
exclude:
  # Exclude pod named blee.
  - blee
  # Exclude all pod name that start with nginx.
  - rx:nginx
  # Exclude all pod that contain -duh ie blee-duh and fred-duh.
  - rx:.*-duh
```

> NOTE: Malformed regex issues will be surfaced in the logs! Please use `popeye version` for logs location.

### Performance part Duh

In my speed up excitements, I've spaced checking for clusters that don't currently support metrics. This yield to an npe ;(. This should now be resolved. Sorry about this waffle thin disruption in the force!
