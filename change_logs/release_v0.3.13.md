## Change Logs

### Add over-allocs flag

Popeye is designed to report sanitization on a live cluster. As such when a cluster is mainly idle, the over allocation report may yield false positives. To this end, we've added a `--over-allocs` option to the CLI to opt-in over allocations reports. By default this option will be off, hence no over cpu/memory allocations will be reported. This now gives you an option to report allocation based on cluster load.
